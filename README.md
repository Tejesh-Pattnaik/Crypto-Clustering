# Crypto Clustering

# Data Processing and Normalizing
The information has been brought into the dataset, and the "Coin ID" is designated as the primary identifier. To gain insights into the fundamental patterns, a line graph is generated to illustrate the percentage changes in price over various time periods. Subsequently, the price change percentages are adjusted for normalization using the StandardScaler function. This normalization is done to ensure that all features have consistent scales, enhance the performance of the model, and make it more resilient to outliers.

# Clustering

# 1. K-Means Clustering

Determining the Optimal Value for "k" Using the Original Data via the Elbow Method.
The elbow method is a technique for determining the most suitable value of k in a range from 1 to 11, which is chosen based on the point at which the inertia decreases the most before forming a noticeable elbow-shaped bend. According to the Elbow Curve Method, the most suitable value for 'k' appears to be 4 because the curve exhibits a clear bend or elbow point at that specific position.

Grouping cryptocurrencies with K-means using the raw data.
The K-means model is set up with an optimal value of k, which is 4. Then, the cryptocurrencies are assigned to clusters using the "fit_predict" function. After that, a scatter plot is generated where the x-axis represents "price_change_percentage_24h" and the y-axis represents "price_change_percentage_7d."

# 2. K-Means Clustering using PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to condense the features into three principal components.

To determine the most suitable value for 'k,' the elbow method is utilized. The range for 'k' is set from 1 to 11, and the dataset containing the PCA components is employed for this purpose.
Utilizing the Elbow Curve Method, we've determined that the most suitable value for the parameter 'k' in K-means clustering is 4, as the curve exhibits an elbow point at that particular position.

We then proceed to apply the K-means model with 'k' set to 4, using the 'fit_predict' function to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their features. A scatter plot is generated by selecting the 'PCA1' and 'PCA2' components, which correspond to the first and second principal components of the data, as the x and y axes, respectively


# Comparison
K-Means clustering with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the data's dimensionality and enhance clustering by minimizing noise, especially in high-dimensional datasets. When comparing the clusters of Cryptocurrencies, it becomes evident that K-Means clustering with PCA results in more effective clustering with reduced noise. It's worth noting that the original dataset wasn't particularly high-dimensional, and traditional K-Means clustering on the raw data still produced effective clustering results.
